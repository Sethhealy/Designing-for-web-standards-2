		<h2> About us </h2>
			<p> Seth A. Healy & Sons is a starting company that is based on a company that my great grandfather started in the 1890's although the concepts have changed our morals are the same. This is a family company with our roots firmly placed in our homes. Our company is not a big company infact we haven't even come out with our first product, but don't mistake that for not being a real company with real ideas because we are. Our first product is in the making so soon it will be out for the world to see. </p>
